    <h2>Volunteer & Service Experience</h2>
    <p>
      I have volunteered extensively through my church, my school, Beta Club, and on my own. My experience includes childcare, camera and lighting support for events, food serving, and general assistance wherever needed. I have also taken part in many homeschool field trips and service projects, contributing to a wide range of community activities.

    <h2>Volunteer Event Organizer</h2>
    <p>
      Although leadership is not my strongest area, I have successfully planned and set up volunteer activities when needed. Most recently, I organized a Bloom Closet sorting day, coordinating the setup and helping ensure the event ran smoothly.

    <h2>Student Technology Helper</h2>
    <p>
      I regularly assist others with computer-related issues, including troubleshooting small problems, helping them understand new tools, and guiding them through basic tasks. I also help peers with Scratch coding, including debugging, adding new features, and teaching new concepts.
      Hi, I’m James — a creative and curious student developer who got into coding through my love of games. I used to design games on paper, and discovering that everything I imagined could be built on a screen pushed me to learn more. I started with Scratch and eventually moved into JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, and other tools so I could bring my ideas to life. I’ve always been fascinated by how computers work, how to uncover hidden systems, and how to protect information, which naturally led me toward an interest in cybersecurity. As the world changes, AI has become another area that fascinates me — understanding how intelligent systems work, how they learn, and how they can be built is a goal I have set as a future step in my journey. I’m constantly exploring new ways to build, experiment, and understand the technology around me.

    <h2>Student Developer</h2>
    <p>
      I have built a variety of tech-related projects, including Scratch games, small websites, and STEM or robotics builds. These projects have helped me develop problem-solving skills, creativity, and a deeper understanding of how technology works.
